## about my self:
I'm Maxim. I am 25. At the moment I work in the Minsk metro (security inspector). Education: secondary special "conductor of a passenger carriage". I did not do well in school or college, I just slept all the years of my studies. I began my development by reading books and began to think about changing my life thanks to them. So I got to RS school. My level of English is beginner. But I am always ready to learn, for example, a month ago I had no idea what HTML and CSS are.
